# CPD--SAS--Programming_for_R_Users
Notes and labs from SAS Programming for R Users

This course is for experienced R users who want to apply their existing skills and extend them to the SAS environment. Emphasis is placed on programming and not statistical theory or interpretation. Students in this course should have knowledge of plotting, manipulating data, iterative processing, creating functions, applying functions, linear models, generalized linear models, mixed models, stepwise model selection, matrix algebra, and statistical simulations.

### Learn how to:
- read and write SAS programs
- import various forms of data
- subset and merge data tables
- do iterative processing and simulate new data
- create new variables and functions
- create and enhance plots of all types
- apply descriptive and inferential procedures including regression, logistic regression, analysis of variance, stepwise model selection, and mixed models
- conduct matrix algebra and statistical simulations in the interactive matrix language (IML)
- call R from SAS to use as a complimentary resource
